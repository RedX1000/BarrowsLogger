# Instructions on how to use

### Capture Rewards
1. Open the Barrows chest.
    * Make sure Barrows rewards window is not covered in order to get a correct reading; list of things to not obfuscate at [Additional Information](#additional-information) and [Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing](#avoiding-menus-causing-multi-capturing-a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).
2. Press the Capture button, press Alt+1, or enable Autocapture to record the Barrows reward interface.
3. Wait a bit, recording can be less than 600ms or over 5 seconds seconds depending on the amount of rewards in the window and the image searching algorithmn used (Some users experience longer times than usual. Tweak with the settings or DM me if this happens).
4. Rewards appear in the BarrowsLogger interface with the value, and a dynamic display that updates when new rewards come in, the total number of rewards logged, and the total and average value for the number of logged Barrows chests. Captured rewards are also saved within the [history](#history-rollback) for review and deletion. <br><br>

### Autocapture
* Barrows rewards can be autocaptured by clicking on the lock (Closed == On, Open == Off).
* This is turned off by default. Click the lock to enable it.
* When opening settings or Clear Options Menu buttons, autocapture is automatically disabled.
* **Be careful to not cover details in the Barrows reward window**, specifically "Current Reward Value: X" coins, and the Barrows rewards. There is code in place to help avoid this for values, but it can happen if 2 values from the left are left uncovered. If this happens for items, perform a [rollback](#history-rollback).
* List of things to not hover over below at [Additional Information](#additional-information) and [Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing](#avoiding-menus-causing-multi-capturing-a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).
* Easy way to fix a misread is to disable autocapture, rolling it backand recapturing it. 
* If some items are not reading correctly when capturing, it is most likely caused by icons loading in. Check to see if [lag detection](#miscellaneous-toggles) settings are on in the BarrowsLogger [settings](#settings) and manually roll it back. The rewards should be automatically recaptured.
* If BarrowsLogger reads the incorrect items displayed on screen, roll it back and try again. If it reads incorrectly again adjust your [image searching algorithm](#image-searching-algorithm) settings and try again. Feel free to reach out to my DMs on Discord for any questions on this.
* In the event of a multi-capture from not obfuscating the value, pause Autocapture, perform a rollback, and open the next Barrows chest, then re-enable autocapture.
* In the rare event that the value of the next Barrows rewards is equivalent to the value of the previous Barrows reward, disable Autocapture and manually capture the reward. <br><br>

### Export to CSV
* Export to CSV will create a comma separated value file of the your Barrows rewards and Barrows history from `localStorage` and allows the user to download the file.
* This will be useful for storing data long term or for crowdsourcing data, i.e. Recording Barrows drop-rates or clan Barrows events.<br>
![CSV Example](/Readme%20Images/CSV%20demo.png "CSV Example") <br>
![CSV Example](/Readme%20Images/CSV%20History%20demo.png "CSV History Example; Open image to see details") <br><br>

### History (Rollback)
* History will open a menu that displays every captured Barrows reward of the currently selected type that can be rolled back and deleted.
* By default, History will the display the last 25 items you've captured. This can be adjusted in the [Settings](#settings) under History Display Limit. 
* Rollbacks performed in History will remove the given reward items quantities, its value, and its counter.
* When you click "Delete", verification buttons "Yes" and "No" will appear in it's place. Upon clicking yes, the given entry will be deleted from `localStorage` and the display will update to reflect this. If the deleted entry is the first in the list, the recently captured rewards display will clear itself. Clicking "No" will revert the button back to "Delete".<br>
* These displayed Barrows rewards persist between sessions, so rewards can be rolled back from `localStorage` at any time.
* This is great if you accidentally scan a reward twice, trigger a multi-capture, or if BarrowsLogger incorrectly identifies an item or value (Ways to mitigate multi-capture from value obfuscation jump to [Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing](#avoiding-menus-causing-multi-capturing-a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).) <br>
![History Example](/Readme%20Images/HistorySample.png "History Example") <br><br>

### Insert
* Insert allows users to directly manipulate `localStorage` by allowing users to add or subtract items by manually creating a new entry to be inserted into the database.
* To remove items from `localStorage`, make the value and quantities of items negative before inserting.
* The Fetch GE button uses the Runescape Wiki's APIs for pulling the current price of the selected items and autofills the reward value based on the item prices and quantity.
* Entries inserted into `localStorage` are marked in the History menu with a <span style="color:red; font-size: 11px; font-family: trajan-pro-3;">[C]</span> which means "Custom".
* To insert items into `localStorage`:
    * Select the items you want to enter into the database.
    * Set the quantity of items you are trying to add.
    * Set the value manually or by selecting the "Fetch GE" button.
    * Click confirm and review the verification page.
    * Click confirm to add it into `localStorage`. <br><br>

### Clear Options Menu
* Clear Options Menu has multiple choices that determine the scope of how much you want to delete from the database of items.
* There are confirm windows for each option except Refresh page.
1. Reset Settings: Sets settings back to default settings. Default settings are marked with an asterisk or in hover-over text.
2. Clear all items from database: Clears the database of quantities and values of items and rewards.
3. Completely reset BarrowsLogger: Nuclear option, **COMPLETELY** resets BarrowsLoggers settings and database. This is a recommended last option for troubleshooting. A value within `localStorage` may or may not change between updates (I try not to), and if it turns out that it breaks it, give this a try, otherwise reach out to me on Discord and we'll chat about it ðŸ™‚. 
4. Refresh page: Refreshes the plugin webpage, does not delete anything.  <br><br>

### Toggleable loot tabs
* Click on the loot tab title to hide the loot, and click it again to show the loot.
* Hidden tabs will be strikethroughed, and the space below it will be hidden.
* Hovering over it will give a tooltip on whether you can hide or show the loot. <br><br>

## Settings
* Settings allow for user choice of Algorithm for icon recognition and miscellaneous settings toggles.
* Hover over the corresponding buttons title to learn more about what it does. <br><br>

### Image Searching Algorithm
1. ResembleJS: Image recognition library using [`ResembleJS`](https://github.com/rsmbl/Resemble.js) that compares entire images and returns a percentage value. It is slow, but it is very accurate. 
2. Pixelmatch: Image recognition library using [`Pixelmatch`](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) that compares images pixel by pixel for and returns a percentage value. It is very fast, but can be less accurate than ResembleJS.
    * Recommended image collections: OrgList or OrgMinus, but you can use any library with good speed. There is a known issue with TwoPlus and All Items libraries listed below.
    * Pixelmatch may have an issue where some items read incorrectly as it did in OpenLogger. If this happens, try using Hybrid or ResembleJS or send me a DM on Discord if you run into other misreads with this configuration. 
3. Hybrid: A mix of the two. Pixelmatch runs first then ResembleJS. Great balance of speed and accuracy. Enabled by default.
    * Hybrid precision can be adjusted using Hybrid Alg Precision setting in the settings menu, listed below. <br><br>

### Miscellaneous Toggles
1. Lag Detection: Determines whether lag should be detected when scanning Barrows rewards. When on, it will try to rescan it again. In the event that it does not capture everything due to lag, perform a rollback and try again.
2. Multi button prevention: Prevents the user from accidentally multi-logging rewards by disabling the capture button when autocapture is on and when the plugin is trying to capture rewards.
3. No Menu Highlighter: Displays a box where the user should prevent menus appearing at all costs while AutoCapture is on. A menu appearing in this area could potentially cause a double capture, but it is rollback-able. More information on how to avoid a multi-capture, [click here](#avoiding-menus-causing-multi-capturing-a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).
4. Hybrid Alg Precision: Allows the user to adjust the precision of the Hybrid image recognition algorithm.
    * The lower the value, the higher the precision. The higher the precision, the faster it runs, but the less accurate it could potentially be, and vice versa. 
    * Default value is 0.7, minimum value is 0.1, maximum value is 1.0. Setting this value higher or lower than this will be auto-capped.
    * ___WARNING!!___ Bringing this value below 0.4 may break BarrowsLogger or miscapture when capturing coins or a few other items.
6. History Display Limit: Limits the number of latest Barrows rewards displayed within the History menu. Default value is 25, minimum value is 0. <br><br>

    * **Everything else is free game to cover. More details below about preventing multi-capturing over the value** <br><br>

* ### Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing: A few tips on where to avoid having menus appearing over the value
    * It IS **_NOT_** safe to have a menu pop up if covering ONLY the value itself. BarrowsLogger WILL capture if you cover up the value such that ONLY the value is covered up like this <span style="font-size: 9px;">(I know this is a clue reward screenie, but rule still applies ðŸ¤«)</span>:<br>![Menu covering only the value](/Readme%20Images/menu%20screen1.png "Menu covering only value")

    * It **_IS_** safe to hover over or right click items as long as the menu resulting from it can cover the "Current Reward Value" text, but try to avoid it. A few examples of safe menus:<br>
    ![Hover-over menu covering both value and 'Current Reward Value'"](/Readme%20Images/menu%20screen2.png "Hover-over menu covering both value and 'Current Reward Value'")<br>
    ![Right click menu covering only the 'Current Reward Value'"](/Readme%20Images/menu%20screen3.png "Right click menu covering only 'Current Reward Value'")
    * In the event that a capture is auto-triggered due to this, roll it back in the [History menu](#history-rollback) <br><br>

* ### This plugin stores data using `localStorage` within Alt1, therefore it can remember all of the loot you have gotten between sessions unless it is cleared. To access it:

    1. Right click the plugin anywhere <br>
    2. Click "Inspect element" <br>
    3. Click the "Application" tab <br>
    4. On the left-hand side, under "Storage", click "Local Storage" <br>
    5. Click the link under "Local Storage" <br>
        - To Clear `localStorage` completely it can be done in one of two ways: <br>   
            1. Select "Completely Reset BarrowsLogger" in the Clear Options Menu and select "Reset Everything" (Easiest best choice). <br>
            2. Right click the link under Local Storage and select "Clear". <br><br>

* ### BarrowsLogger can be stretched out widthwise to display more of the loot in its display, as the top is flexy, and if you compress the bottom, you can have a minimal box for only seeing scanned items: 
    ![BarrowsLogger Tall Top](/Readme%20Images/BarrowsLogger%20Tall%20Top.png "BarrowsLogger Tall Top") <br>
    ![BarrowsLogger Wide Top](/Readme%20Images/BarrowsLogger%20Wide%20Top.png "BarrowsLogger Wide") <br>
    ![BarrowsLogger Wide](/Readme%20Images/BarrowsLogger%20Wide.png "BarrowsLogger Wide") <br><br>

### Potential or planned updates
* None here! Maybe there are a few on the OpenLogger project...
<!--* Better legacy interface support; I don't test with it much. Legacy interface can log clues and perform lag detection checks, but I do not have a reroll window detection set for legacy mode, and I would need to iron out any bugs or kinks that appear. Use at your own risk.-->
